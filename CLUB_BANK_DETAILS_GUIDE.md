# Club Bank Details Management Guide

This guide explains how clubs can add their bank details to receive direct payments through the Razorpay integration. There are two payment models available:

1. **Platform Collection Model** (Simpler) - Platform collects payments, distributes to clubs
2. **Direct Payment Model** (Advanced) - Payments go directly to club accounts via Razorpay Route

## üí≥ Payment Models

### **Model 1: Platform Collection (Recommended for Start)**

**How it works:**
1. All payments go to main platform Razorpay account
2. Platform tracks which payments belong to which clubs
3. Platform manually transfers money to clubs periodically
4. Clubs provide bank details for transfers

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Simple setup - no Razorpay verification needed for clubs
- ‚úÖ Quick implementation
- ‚úÖ Platform has full control over payments
- ‚úÖ Easy reconciliation

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Manual transfer process
- ‚ùå Clubs wait for platform to transfer money
- ‚ùå Platform holds money temporarily

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Event payment goes to platform account
const paymentData = {
  amount: eventAmount,
  currency: 'INR',
  receipt: `event_${eventId}_${Date.now()}`,
  notes: {
    event_id: eventId,
    club_id: clubId,
    payment_for: 'event_registration'
  }
};

// Platform tracks club earnings
const clubEarnings = {
  club_id: clubId,
  event_id: eventId,
  amount: eventAmount,
  status: 'pending_transfer',
  payment_id: razorpayPaymentId
};
```

### **Model 2: Direct Payment via Razorpay Route (Advanced)**

**How it works:**
1. Each club gets a Razorpay linked account
2. Payments are automatically split and sent to club accounts
3. Platform can take a commission (optional)
4. Real-time settlement to club accounts

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic payment distribution
- ‚úÖ Real-time settlement
- ‚úÖ No manual transfers needed
- ‚úÖ Transparent payment tracking

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Complex setup - requires club verification
- ‚ùå Razorpay Route has additional fees
- ‚ùå Clubs need business verification
- ‚ùå More complex reconciliation

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Create linked account for club
const linkedAccount = await razorpay.accounts.create({
  email: clubBankDetails.contact_email,
  phone: clubBankDetails.contact_phone,
  type: 'route',
  reference_id: `club_${clubId}`,
  legal_business_name: clubBankDetails.account_holder_name
});

// Add bank account to linked account
const bankAccount = await razorpay.accounts.addBankAccount(
  linkedAccount.id,
  {
    account_number: clubBankDetails.account_number,
    ifsc_code: clubBankDetails.ifsc_code,
    beneficiary_name: clubBankDetails.account_holder_name
  }
);

// Create payment with route
const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
  amount: eventAmount,
  currency: 'INR',
  transfers: [
    {
      account: linkedAccount.id,
      amount: eventAmount * 0.95, // 95% to club, 5% platform fee
      currency: 'INR',
      notes: {
        event_id: eventId,
        club_id: clubId
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

## üîß Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Choose Payment Model**

**For Platform Collection Model:**
1. Use existing Razorpay integration
2. Add bank details collection for clubs
3. Implement manual transfer tracking
4. Create transfer management dashboard

**For Direct Payment Model:**
1. Implement Razorpay Route integration
2. Add linked account creation API
3. Implement automatic payment splitting
4. Add verification status tracking

### **Step 2: Database Schema**

```javascript
// Firebase structure for club bank details
club_bank_details: {
  [clubId]: {
    // Basic bank info
    account_holder_name: "string",
    account_number: "string",
    ifsc_code: "string",
    bank_name: "string",
    branch_name: "string",
    account_type: "savings|current",
    upi_id: "string",
    
    // Contact info
    contact_name: "string",
    contact_email: "string",
    contact_phone: "string",
    business_type: "string",
    
    // Address
    address_line1: "string",
    address_line2: "string",
    city: "string",
    state: "string",
    pincode: "string",
    
    // Razorpay Route (if using Model 2)
    razorpay_account_id: "string",
    razorpay_bank_account_id: "string",
    verification_status: "pending|under_review|verified|rejected",
    
    // Metadata
    created_at: "ISO string",
    updated_at: "ISO string",
    created_by: "user_id"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Security Considerations**
