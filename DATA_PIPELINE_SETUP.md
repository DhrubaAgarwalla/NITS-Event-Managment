1. **Login as Admin** to your event manager
2. **Go to Admin Dashboard** (the admin panel you already use)
3. **Click on "🔄 Data Pipeline" tab** (newly added next to Google Sheets tab)

### **Direct URL:**
- Your pipeline dashboard is now available at: `your-domain.com/admin` → Data Pipeline tab

## 🛠 **What You Can Do Now**

### **1. View Pipeline Status**
- See if the pipeline is running or stopped
- Check how many records have been processed
- Monitor error rates and component health

### **2. Control Pipeline**
- **Start Pipeline**: Begin processing your event data
- **Stop Pipeline**: Pause data processing
- **Manual Run**: Trigger immediate data processing

### **3. View Analytics**
- **Registration Trends**: See daily registration patterns
- **Processing Metrics**: Monitor data quality and performance
- **Component Health**: Check if all parts are working properly

## 📊 **What the Pipeline Actually Does**

### **Real-Time Data Processing:**
```
Your Event Registration → Pipeline Processes → Analytics Dashboard
```

**Example Flow:**
1. Someone registers for an event
2. Pipeline automatically captures the data
3. Validates and cleans the information
4. Creates analytics features (like engagement scores)
5. Stores in organized database for reporting

### **Analytics You Get:**
- **Daily registration trends**
- **Event popularity metrics**
- **User engagement scores**
- **Payment completion rates**
- **Attendance predictions**

## 🎯 **How to Use It**

### **Step 1: Start the Pipeline**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Data Pipeline tab
2. Click "▶️ Start Pipeline" button
3. Wait for status to show "Running"

### **Step 2: Let It Process Your Data**
- The pipeline will automatically process your existing events and registrations
- New registrations will be processed in real-time
- Check the metrics to see progress

### **Step 3: View Insights**
- Look at the registration trends chart
- Check processing statistics
- Monitor component health

### **Step 4: Trigger Manual Runs**
- Click "🔄 Manual Run" to force immediate processing
- Useful when you want fresh analytics quickly

## 📈 **Understanding the Dashboard**

### **Pipeline Status Section:**
- **Green Dot**: Pipeline is running and healthy
- **Red Dot**: Pipeline is stopped or has issues
- **Metrics**: Shows total records and batches processed

### **Component Health:**
- **Ingestion**: Captures data from your Firebase
- **Processing**: Cleans and validates data
- **Warehouse**: Stores organized data for analytics

### **Analytics Section:**
- **Registration Trends**: Bar chart showing daily registrations
- **Processing Stats**: Numbers showing data quality metrics

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Pipeline Won't Start:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Make sure you're logged in as admin

### **If No Data Shows:**
1. Make sure you have events and registrations in your system
2. Try clicking "Manual Run" to force processing
3. Wait a few minutes for processing to complete

### **If Charts Are Empty:**
1. The pipeline needs some data to show trends
2. Create a few test events and registrations
3. Trigger a manual run to process them

## 🎯 **What This Demonstrates**

### **For Your Portfolio:**
- **Real-time data processing** capabilities
- **System monitoring** and health checks
- **Analytics dashboard** creation
- **API design** and integration
- **Production-ready** error handling

### **For Interviews:**
- You can show a working data pipeline
