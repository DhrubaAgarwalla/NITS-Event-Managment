# 📊 Google Sheets Auto-Sync Feature

## Overview

Your event management system now has **automatic Google Sheets creation and real-time updates**! Every event automatically gets its own Google Sheet that stays synchronized with live data.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Automatic Sheet Creation**
- ✅ **When you create an event** → Google Sheet is automatically created
- ✅ **Sheet is named**: `{Event Title} - Event Registrations`
- ✅ **Sheet URL is stored** in the event data for easy access
- ✅ **Works in background** - event creation continues even if sheet creation fails

### **Real-time Auto-Sync**
The Google Sheet automatically updates when:
- 👤 **New Registration** - Someone registers for your event
- 📱 **QR Code Attendance** - Participant scans QR code to mark attendance
